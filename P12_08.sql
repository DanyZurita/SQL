/* Create 4 users: */

/* 1. A DBA user (name "userAdmin"). */

    

/* 2. Database Admin (name "userDbAdmin"): Work on all databases, create collections, create indexes, 
etc. But it's not allowed to create users… */

    

/* 3. User Admin (name "userAdm"): Allowed to manage users. */

    

/* 4. Developer (name "userDev"): Read and write data in "customers" and "sales" databases. */

    

/* 5. Finally, show all the created users inside the database "admin" and "customers". */

    

/* Obviously, you must check the built-in roles… */
